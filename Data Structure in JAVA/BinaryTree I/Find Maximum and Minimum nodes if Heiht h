Que-1. The height of a tree is the length of the longest root-to-leaf path in it. The maximum and the minimum number of nodes in a binary tree of height 5 are: 

(A) 63 and 6, respectively 
(B) 64 and 5, respectively 
(C) 32 and 6, respectively 
(D) 31 and 5, respectively 



Solution: According to formula discussed, 
max number of nodes = 2^(h+1)-1 = 2^6-1 =63. 
min number of nodes = h+1 = 5+1 = 6.
