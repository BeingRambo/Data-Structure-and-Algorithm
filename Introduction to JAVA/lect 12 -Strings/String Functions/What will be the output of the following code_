What will be the output of the following code:

String a ="abcd";
String b="abcda";
System.out.println(a.compareTo(b));

Ans: -1

Note: The compareTo function returns the difference of length of strings when they are not equal.In case if the lengths are equal,
then it returns the non-zero difference in ASCII values starting from 0th index to (n-1)st index and if all the indices of string are same, it returns 0.
