Output problem

What will be the output of the following code:
public static void main (String[] args) {
String str1="abc";
String str2="bc";
String str3="ab"+str2;
System.out.println(str1==str3);
}


Ans: false

Note:  str1==str   we are checking reference addresses are equals but if string are not same then in string pool
that will store in diff memory location thats why they are not equals
