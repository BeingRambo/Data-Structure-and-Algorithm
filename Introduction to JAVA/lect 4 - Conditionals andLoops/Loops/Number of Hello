The number of Hello printed on the screen for the following code will be:
public static void main (String[] args) {
    int x=5;
    int y=5;
    while((x=5)==y)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello");
        x++;
        y++;
    }
}




Output: one


Note:
 if Y=5 then it will print hello but after incrementing y will become y=6 then ((x=5)==y) int this y=6 then it will terminate
 
 The loop is executed only once when y=5.

The condition is false when y=6.
