Which line(s) of the following code would give an error:

public static void main (String[] args) {
    int a=10,b=20;
    System.out.println(a+++--b);//line 1
    System.out.println(a--+++b);//line 2
    System.out.println(a++-++b);//line 3
    System.out.println(a+++++b);//line 4
}


Ans:
Line 2
Line 4


Note:
As + operator and ++ operator have equal precedence.
Similarly - and -- have equal precedence.
So in line 2 +++b and in line 4 +++b gives an error.
To solve this error we can use +(++b).
