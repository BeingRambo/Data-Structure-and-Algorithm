Time complexity

In a competition, four different functions are observed. All the functions use a single for loop and within the for loop, same set of statements(with constant time) are executed. Consider the following for loops:
A) for(i = 0; i < n; i++) 

B) for(i = 0; i < n; i += 2) 

C) for(i = 1; i < n; i *= 2) 

D) for(i = n; i > 0; i /= 2) 
If n is the size of input(positive), which function(s) is/are the most efficient?

Output: 
C
D
