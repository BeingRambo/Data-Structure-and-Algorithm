What will be the output of the following code:


public static int sum(int a,int b)
{
    System.out.print("int sum ");
    return a+b;
}
public static long sum(long a,long b)
{
    System.out.print("long sum ");
    return a+b;
}
public static void main (String[] args) {
        int a=4;
        int b=5;
    System.out.print(sum(a,b));
}




Output: int sum 9


Note: As both the datatypes are int So first function would be called.
